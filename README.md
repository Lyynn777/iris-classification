# Iris Flower Classification

This project contains a machine learning model for classifying iris flowers based on their features using Python, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.

## Dataset

The dataset used is `IRIS.csv`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow

## Instructions

1. Upload the `IRIS.csv` file to your working directory.
2. Run the `iris_classification.py` script.

## Model Training

The script trains two models:
1. A RandomForest model using scikit-learn.
2. A neural network model using TensorFlow.

The results and performance metrics are printed after training.

## How to Run

```bash
python iris_classification.py
